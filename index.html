<script id='ideal_employment' type='text/markdown'>
The ideal qualities I look for in a company:

- The work improves peoples lives.
- Productivity and morale are valued more highly than bureaucracy.
- Pride is taken in the company's identity and it's work.
- Great effort is spent hiring the right people.
- Failures are discussed openly and seen as necessary to innovation.

|Language|Background|
|-
|Javascript|A powerful, functional language.  A _little_ rough around the edges, but still my personal favourite.|
|C#|A recent addition, but one I am passionate about mastering.  I've worked with ASP.NET MVC and WCF|
|HTML5/CSS |I both love and loathe working with HTML5.  Love it for it being open, loathe it for it's inconsistency.|
|Java SE + EE|My first language - helped convert my brain into an OOP machine.  It can be verbose, but I appreciate it's clarity.|
|Python|I revere Python  for it's ability to consume REST endpoints in 2 lines of code - that and Dictionary comprehensions, they are so cool!|

Some technologies, of which I am an avid user and appreciator:

|Technologies|Background|
|-
|Markdown|I use markdown for all my documentation and readme files (including this CV).|
|git|Wouldn't leave the house without it.|
|Sublime Text 2|My weapon of choice.  Fast, smart and beautiful.|
|NodeJS|Being able to share client and server side code is a dream come true.|
|Regular Expressions|A dark and confounding art, shrouded in mystery.|
|Jasmine|A test suite written in Javascript with an inspiring, readable syntax.|
|Backbone.js|A vanishing cream for your web app's complexity.  Also, an MVC Javascript framework.|
|underscore.js|Where ECMAScript will be in 5 years, so why wait?|
|JQuery|Takes the most boring of tasks (manipulating the DOM) and makes it fun!  That says _a lot_ about good API design.|
|Node Webkit|Desktop applications powered by web code.|

Some techniques I employ regularly:

|Technique|Advantages|Informative Information|
|-
|Recursion over Iteration|Cleaner code, easier to read, easier to maintain.|If you don't fully comprehend recursion, that's ok! Ask somebody to explain it to you.  If they don't know, they can ask somebody to explain it to them.  If they don't know... well you get the idea.|
|Generalised Logic|Generalisation encourages code reuse.|So this object walks into a container...|
|Short, well named functions over comprehensive comments.|Code can never lie to the compiler, but comments can mislead the programmer.  Comments should only ever explain why you avoided a convention.|/\*No Comment\*/|
|Short classes, shorter methods.|A class should be the master of only one trade.  This leads to modular, reusable, decoupled code.  All the OOP good things.|You want your code to be as specific as possible.  But most of all you want it to be generalised!|
|Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)|A business logic/state item should only be defined/stored in one place.|Do not, I repeat, do not repeat yourself.|

<script id='history' type='text/markdown'>
I commenced studying _Mechatronical Engineering_ at the _University of Technology, Sydney_ in 2008. It was there I discovered my love for programming. I recieved a High Distinction in all computer science subjects. 

After solving a packing algorithm related to pipe proving for the National Broadband Network project, I was offered a job at _Silcar Communications_ on the NBN Project. 

Working on the NBN Project for 2 years gave me experience with many languages, the agile methodology and GIS systems.  I made a significant impact on the projects core systems through innovative approaches that were celebrated by our clients.  I was awarded the Bright Ideas Rockstar Award after pitching a crowdsourced solution for NBN's design through the medium of an online social game.

Silcar allowed me to experience many different approaches, technologies and systems.  Primarily these systems were focused on the back end.  

More recently I've worked in front end developent, building _the_ best photo management system at DPHOTO.

- Introduced Test Driven Development.
- Advocated a pure RESTful API, which reduced complexity in all other systems.
- I significantly reduced the existing codebase in size (by an order of magnitude), using generalisation and _convention over configuration_.
- Solved Backbone.js' inability to handle nested model/collection relationships, with a simple but effective convention.


###2013-Current __DPHOTO__

####Experience Summary
Currently I am working with DPHOTO as a Javascript Front End Developer.  We are pouring all of our energy into building a powerful online photo management website.

|Projects|Technologies|Details
|-
|RESTful Server Synchronisation|Backbone.js|Refactoring the previous server class to take advantage of all that Backbone, underscore and JQuery have to offer.|
|Test Suite|Jasmine|Introduced a test driven design approach to the team.  Every feature has a corresponding test.  This provides confidence that the site is stable at all times.|
|Automatic Invoicing|Markdown,Python|DPHOTO uses online calendar's to keep track of development.  I automated my personal invoicing by accessesing this online calendar data to build beautiful invoices on the fly.|
|A powerful and simple menu system|Javascript|Designed and delivered a powerful, dynamic menu system. The system observes suitable functions on a group of models and presents them in a menu when contextually appropriate.|

###2013-2011 __Silcar Communications__

####Experience Summary
Silcar Communications works as a subcontractor for mining and telecommunications projects.  I work within a GeoSpatial Automation team.  The applications we have developed are utilised nationally, client-side and company wide.

|Projects										|Technologies|Details
|-
|On Demand - Telstra FIR Report| C# (WCF) + AJAX|Previews a report (generated as a view in the database).  A well formatted Excel workbook is then generated and populated with the selected data.  This workbook is then available to download on demand.
|Mandrel Packing Algorithm Visualisation| HTML + Javascript| A web app that displays how many cables could fit in a conduit.  The user can pick any combination of standard cable/conduit types, and the packing will be visualised using HTML5 Canvas.|
|Automatic HTML Logging|Markdown + HTML + Javascript + Twitter Bootstrap|A logging utility that outputs well formatted plain text in the console while also logging the output to a generated styled HTML file.  This allowed for more _client friendly_ log files. 
|Report Automation|Java + C#|Automatic generation and distribution of mission critical workbooks with complex report logic.
|APEX Web App Integration with Scheduling Database | C# + Java| Automatic synchronisation of a propietary scheduling database and an Oracle database.
|Excel Formula to SQL Parsing and Conversion| Python + C# | Uses Python for pattern recognition and C# for it's integration with Excel.
|Detailed Design Checker|Python|Verification of NBN network design.  Performs multiple geographic geometry tests.|
|Various Conversion Tools|Python + Java + C#|Conversion of one data format to the other e.g XML,JSON,CSV,XLS,GML,Shapefile|
|Address retrieval and population|Python|Appends street address information to an Geographic XML.  Address information is retrieved using a REST endpoint and Latitude and Longitude.|
|Surface Type Detection|Javascript + Google Maps API + Python|Verifies the surface material of the ground at a particular latitude/longitude using image analysis.|
|NBN: The Game| N/A |Pitched a crowd sourced game that would allow Australian citizens to design the NBN network within a game.  It was well received and voted best idea by our clients at the Bright Ideas Conference|

- Awarded the _Rock Star Award_ by General Manager, Saiful Chowdhury
- Voted favourite presentation by major clients including NBN Chief Executive Officer, Michael Quigley

**48 Hour Game Jams**

I participate in a game jam 3-4 times a year.
 
A Game jam is a competition to design and implement a game _from scratch_ in a small amount of time.

Participating in game jams allow me to:

- Experiment with new designs, languages and approaches.
- Evaluate my ability to pre-empt a player or users interactions.
- Experience the full life cycle of a project _rapidly_.

You can play a recent jam game, Provider, [here](http://canyonthings.com/provider/).

**Writing/Performing Songs**

I started to play the guitar at an early age and began writing songs soon after.

I played for many years in a three piece garage rock band, _Baby X_.  We played regularly in Sydney for 4 years.

You can listen to some of our recordings on the [_Baby X_](http://babyx.bandcamp.com/) website.
